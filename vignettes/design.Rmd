stackgbm aims to provide a minimalist, research-friendly code base
for GBDT model stacking.

## Targeted model types

Focus on the three most impactful GBDT model implementations:
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, to ensure high performance
without unnecessary complexity.

## Robust model selection

Embrace the traditional grid search and cross-validation approach for
parameter tuning, to make model selection robust and understandable.

## Key parameter tuning

Provide tuning options for the most impactful parameters
(learning rate, maximum depth of a tree, and number of iterations) across
GBDT implementations to avoid the risk of overfitting and complexity
associated with excessive parameter tuning.

## Effective defaults

The default parameter grid balances performance and computational cost,
performing effectively across a wide range of scenarios.

## Base R implementation

Build with base R to ensure it is easy to understand, modify, and extend.
