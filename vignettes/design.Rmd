stackgbm aims to deliver a minimalist, research-oriented tool for
model stacking, with a focus on performant GBDT model implementations.

Anticipating that users may eventually need to tailor the code base to
their unique requirements, the design emphasizes simplicity and moderate
flexibility, leading to enhanced customization opportunities.

While this approach may appear to contradict the traditional
"open-closed principle" in software engineering, it affords users a
transparent view of the underlying processes and fosters a deeper
understanding of the steps involved.

## Targeted model types

Focus on the three most impactful GBDT model implementations:
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, to ensure high performance
without unnecessary complexity.

## Robust model selection

Embrace the traditional grid search and cross-validation approach for
parameter tuning, to make model selection robust and understandable.

## Key parameter tuning

Provide tuning options for the most impactful parameters
(learning rate, maximum depth of a tree, and number of iterations) across
GBDT implementations to avoid the risk of overfitting and complexity
associated with excessive parameter tuning.

## Effective defaults

The default parameter grid balances performance and computational cost,
performing effectively across a wide range of scenarios.

## Base R implementation

Build with base R to ensure it is easy to understand, modify, and extend.
